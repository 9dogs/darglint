## [0.0.2]

### Added

- Changelog.

- Handling for methods.  Checks for whether the method is a static
  method or a class method.  Doesn't prompt for documentation for
  "self", or "cls" when not appropriate.

- Change format for error messages to be less verbose.
  The format is now:
    ```
    <function/method name>
      - <missing argument>
      + <extraneous argument>
    ```

## [0.0.1] - 2017-09-18

Began project.  Added check of function definitions.  Buggy and
doesn't handle many options.
