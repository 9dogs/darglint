# Change Log

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.0.2]

### Added

- Changelog.

- Handling for methods.  Checks for whether the method is a static
  method or a class method.  Doesn't prompt for documentation for
  "self", or "cls" when not appropriate.

- Change format for error messages to be less verbose.
  The format is now:
    ```
    <function/method name>
      - <missing argument>
      + <extraneous argument>
    ```

### Changed

- Removed dependency on Red Baron.  This allows us to use line
  numbers, and to parse python which contains type hints.

### Fixed

- Handle functions/methods without docstrings by ignoring them.
  `darglint` should only care about whether a docstring is up to
  date, not whether it is present or not.


## [0.0.1] - 2017-09-18

Began project.  Added check of function definitions.  Buggy and
doesn't handle many options.
